## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2017-10-11
- Fix some documentation bugs, particularly the index page redirecting to README.html
instead of readme.html.

## [0.1.0] - 2017-10-07
- Initial implementation. We'll likely find bugs to fix or interface changes to make when
we integrate with the Elixir Stellar client, so the project should be considered unstable
at this stage.
